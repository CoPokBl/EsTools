# EsTools
A general purpose Essentials like plugin with everything you need but not messing up anything (Beta 1.7.3)

EsTools is a plugin designed to be like EssentialsX in that it provides heaps of 
helpful commands, but unlike essentials it doesn't mess up or override vanilla features (e.g. the give command). 
This plugin doesn't override existing Minecraft commands and therefore is less likely to mess stuff up. However 
because beta 1.7.3 has very few commands, we have re-added a few commands that are in vanilla Minecraft.

This branch is entirely based on developing for [Project Poseidon](https://github.com/RhysB/Project-Poseidon) (Bukkit beta 1.7.3).
The code is this branch will only work on VERY early versions of Minecraft. If you want EsTools for 1.0+ please use the master branch.

## Support
The plugin is designed to work on only beta 1.7.3, although it may work on other early versions.
