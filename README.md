# EsTools
A general purpose Essentials like plugin with everything you need but not messing up anything (1.3 - 1.18)

EsTools is a plugin designed to be like essentials, but unlike essentials it doesn't mess everything up (eg. the give command).  
This plugin doesn't override existing Minecraft commands and therefore is less likely to mess stuff up.
